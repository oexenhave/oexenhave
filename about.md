In short: Positive. Dad. Amateur photographer. Happy. Computer wizard. Curious. Fond of Italian food. Entrepreneur.

I'm a tech lead at TimeLog. I am located in Roskilde, Denmark. I was born July 2nd 1984. I have a great
 passion for technology and at the time being especially for web technology and integrations.

I'm also an amateur photographer keen to learn new techniques both with the camera, but also post-processing the photos. 
If you need a photographer for an event please let me know. In my portfolio, I have photos from a huge 40-years
birthday party and a couple of christening parties and 50th anniversaries - as well as a lot of personal family 
parties and get-togethers.
